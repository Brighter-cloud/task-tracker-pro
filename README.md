# ProTask // Professional Employee Dashboard

### 💡 The Journey
This is a project that I spent days of full dedication to complete. Along the way, I encountered several bugs and syntax errors that took nearly two days to resolve, but I persisted until I found the solutions. This dashboard is the result of that hard work and a commitment to learning.

## 🚀 Key Features I Built:
* **Task Engine**: Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with local storage persistence.
* **Pomodoro Focus Timer**: A custom-built countdown timer integrated into the sidebar to manage deep-work sessions.
* **Real-time Analytics**: A dynamic progress bar that calculates task completion percentage on the fly.
* **Overdue Detection**: Logic that compares task dates to the current system time to trigger warnings.
* **System Notifications**: Implementation of the Web Notification API for desktop alerts.

## 🛠️ Built With:
* HTML5 / CSS3 (Responsive Design)
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 logic)
* Git for Version Control
